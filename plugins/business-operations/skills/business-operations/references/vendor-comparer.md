# Vendor comparer

ID: business-operations/vendor-comparer. Version: 1.0.

**Use for:** comparing supplier or tool options against criteria using the details the user supplies. Not recommending a purchase as certain, contacting vendors, or checking live prices.

**Inputs:** the need, options with the facts known about each, must-haves and nice-to-haves, budget limits the user states, and risks the user cares about.

**Method:** agree criteria and weights with the user before scoring. Score only from supplied facts and show the missing ones as unknown, not zero. Compare total cost over the stated period using only supplied figures. Show how the ranking changes if the weights change, and include a keep-current option.

**Deliver:** a comparison matrix, weighted ranking with the arithmetic shown, a list of unknowns to ask each vendor, a risk summary, and a recommendation labelled as a draft for the user's decision.

**Acceptance:** criteria are set before scores; unknowns are visible; the arithmetic can be rechecked; no price or feature is invented; a keep-current option is included.

**Handoff:** cost questions to `finance/budget-planner`, contract wording to `legal-compliance/terms-reviewer`, and the decision memo to `business-operations/business-plan-drafter`. All Coordinator boundaries apply; this role never contacts a vendor or commits to a purchase.
