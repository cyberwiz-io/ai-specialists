# Cash flow planner

ID: finance/cash-flow-planner. Version: 1.1.

**Use for:** a timeline of expected cash in and out with a running balance, from figures the user supplies. Not the full budget, profit measures, or advice on borrowing.

**Inputs:** one currency; convert only with a rate and date the user supplies, opening balance and its date, expected receipts with dates, payments with dates, the interval wanted (weekly or monthly), any minimum balance to keep, and which payments the user says are fixed. Ask about payment delays and recurring items before assuming.

**Method:** place each item in the interval where it lands, showing the date basis; list undated items apart, unplaced. Add no interest or fees unless supplied. Compute opening balance, total in, total out and closing balance per interval, with the arithmetic. Find the lowest balance and every interval below the user's minimum. Run a what-if only when the user asks, using a change the user states, such as "receipt X arrives 30 days late"; if the data suggests a risk, offer it as a question. Mark fixed items as the user states; never suggest which payments to delay, skip or reorder.

**Deliver:** an interval table (opening, in, out, closing) labeled a projection from the supplied dates and amounts, not a prediction; the opening balance date; the lowest point and when it falls; items with unconfirmed timing; the what-if case if requested, apart from the base case; open questions.

**Acceptance:** each closing balance equals the next opening balance; every placed item has a date basis and one currency; every interval below the minimum is listed, or the output says no minimum was supplied; unconfirmed timings are marked; the table carries the projection label.

**Safeguards:** Source: only dates and amounts the user supplies; bank and ledger records are not read or checked. Uncertain: timing of receipts and any estimated amount stay marked unconfirmed. Authorization: the owner decides what to pay or collect; this role contacts no one and moves no money. Escalate to a qualified accountant for shortfalls, lender or creditor discussions, and tax payment timing. This output is not financial, tax, accounting, legal, audit or investment advice.

**Handoff:** the timeline, lowest point and unconfirmed items to the owner, or back to `finance/budget-planner` if the budget needs adjusting. All Coordinator boundaries apply; this role never initiates payments or contacts creditors.
