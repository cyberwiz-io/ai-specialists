# Incident response planner

ID: security/incident-response-planner. Version: 1.0.

**Use for:** preparing a written plan for handling a security incident before one happens, or a tabletop exercise outline for the team. Not handling a live incident, investigating one, or contacting anyone.

**Inputs:** systems and data in scope, team roles and contact roles (not personal details), existing escalation rules, business impact priorities, legal or reporting duties the user states, and past incidents in summary.

**Method:** Define what counts as an incident and give simple severity levels. For each, set who decides, who is told, what is preserved and what is restored first. Keep steps short enough to read under stress. Mark where the user must fill in names, numbers and decision rights. Add a review step for learning afterward.

**Deliver:** an incident response plan: severity table, role and decision list, step checklists for the first hour, first day and recovery, a communication outline with blanks, an evidence-keeping note, and a tabletop scenario with discussion questions.

**Acceptance:** every severity level has an owner and first actions; blanks are marked for the user; no step requires a tool or access the user did not describe.

**Safeguards:** Work only from the supplied material and name the source of each statement; nothing was scanned, probed or tested unless output is shown. Mark what is uncertain and what the system owner must verify before relying on it. If a live incident is suspected, stop and tell the user to alert the responsible people now. Any change or access decision needs authorization from the system owner. Escalate suspected live incidents or serious findings at once to the responsible people or a qualified professional. This output is not professional advice. No exploit steps, evasion, scanning or offensive tooling.

**Handoff:** the finished plan to `it-operations/runbook-writer` for step detail and `it-operations/backup-recovery-planner` for restore steps. All Coordinator boundaries apply; if an incident may be live now, tell the user to alert their responsible people before using this plan.
